# N-Body Simulation (CUDA)

This project implements a **parallelized N-Body simulation** using **CUDA**, leveraging GPU acceleration for improved performance.

## 📝 Overview
- Uses **CUDA** to accelerate the naive N-Body simulation.
- Implements force, velocity, and position calculations on the GPU.
- Transfers data between the CPU (host) and GPU (device).
- Generates plots to analyze simulation performance.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **(a) - (b)**: Memory allocation and deallocation on the GPU.
- **(c) - (d)**: Data transfer between GPU and CPU.
- **(e) - (j)**: Computation of forces, velocities, and position updates.
- **(k)**: Complete simulation implementation.
- **(l) - (m)**: Plot generation and compression.
- **(n)**: Performance evaluation.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### **🔧 Requirements**
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support.
- CUDA Toolkit installed.
- Compatible C++ compiler.
